## About

A Max-abstraction that generates Lindenmayer System string expansions based on a custom set of rules, axiom and number of generations. Rules are stored in a dictionary and can be accessed from outside the abstraction, or can refer to an external dictionary. The system is generated in javascript and outputs a max-message of the values returned based on the rules. Rules can consist of integers, floats, symbols/strings and single characters.
